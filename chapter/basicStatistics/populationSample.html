        <h1>Statistics - Populations and Samples</h1>
        <p>The terms 'population' and 'sample' are important in statistics and refer to key concepts that are closely related.</p>
        <h2>Population and Samples</h2>
        <p><strong>Population:</strong> Everything in the group that we want to learn about.</p>
        <p><strong>Sample:</strong> A part of the population.</p>
        <p>Examples of populations and a sample from those populations:</p>
        
        <table class="ss-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Population</th>
                <th>Sample</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>All of the people in Germany</td>
                <td>500 Germans</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>All of the customers of Netflix</td>
                <td>300 Netflix customers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Every car manufacturer</td>
                <td>Tesla, Toyota, BMW, Ford</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>For good statistical analysis, the sample needs to be as "similar" as possible to the population. If they are similar enough, we say that the sample is <strong>representative</strong> of the population.</p>
        <p>The sample is used to make conclusions about the whole population. If the sample is not similar enough to the whole population, the conclusions could be useless.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Many words have specific meanings in statistics.</p>
            <p>The word 'population' normally refers to a group of people. In statistics, it is any specific group that we are interested in learning about.</p>
