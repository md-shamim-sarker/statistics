        <h1>Statistics - Sample Types</h1>
        <p>A study needs participants and there are different ways of gathering them.</p>
        <p>Some methods are better than others, but they might be more difficult.</p>
        <h2>Different Types of Sampling Methods</h2>
        <h3>Random Sampling</h3>
        <p>A random sample is where every member of the population has an equal chance to be chosen.</p>
        <p>Random sampling is the best. But, it can be difficult, or impossible, to make sure that it is completely random.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Every other sampling method is compared to how close it is to a random sample - the closer, the better.</p>
        <h3>Convenience Sampling</h3>
        <p>A convenience sample is where the participants that are the easiest to reach are chosen.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Convenience sampling is the easiest to do.</p>
            <p>In many cases this sample will not be similar enough to the population, and the conclusions can potentially be useless.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Systematic Sampling</h3>
        <p>A systematic sample is where the participants are chosen by some regular system.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first 30 people in a queue</li>
            <li>Every third on a list</li>
            <li>The first 10 and the last 10</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stratified Sampling</h3>
        <p>A stratified sample is where the population is split into smaller groups called 'strata'.</p>
        <p>The 'strata' can, for example, be based on demographics, like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Different age groups</li>
            <li>Professions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Stratification of a sample is the first step. Another sampling method (like random sampling) is used for the second step of choosing participants from all of the smaller groups (strata).</p>
        <h3>Clustered Sampling</h3>
        <p>A clustered sample is where the population is split into smaller groups called 'clusters'.</p>
        <p>The clusters are usually natural, like different cities in a country.</p>
        <p>The clusters are chosen randomly for the sample.</p>
        <p>All members of the clusters can participate in the sample, or members can be chosen randomly from the clusters in a third step.</p>
