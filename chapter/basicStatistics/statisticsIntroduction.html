        <h1>Statistics Introduction</h1>
        <p>Statistics gives us methods of gaining knowledge from data.</p>
        <h2>What is Statistics Used for?</h2>
        <p>Statistics is used in all kinds of science and business applications.</p>
        <p>Statistics gives us more accurate knowledge which helps us make better decisions.</p>
        <p>Statistics can focus on making <strong>predictions</strong> about what will happen in the future. It can also focus on <strong>explaining</strong> how different things are connected.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Good statistical explanations are also useful for predictions.</p>
        <h2>Typical Steps of Statistical Methods</h2>
        <p>The typical steps are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gathering data</li>
            <li>Describing and visualizing data</li>
            <li>Making conclusions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to keep all three steps in mind for any questions we want more knowledge about.</p>
        <p>Knowing which types of data are available can tell you what kinds of questions you can answer with statistical methods.</p>
        <p>Knowing which questions you want to answer can help guide what sort of data you need. A lot of data might be available, and knowing what to focus on is important.</p>
        <h2>How is Statistics Used?</h2>
        <p>Statistics can be used to explain things in a precise way. You can use it to understand and make conclusions about the group that you want to know more about. This group is called the <strong>population</strong>.</p>
        <p>A population could be many different kinds of groups. It could be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All of the people in a country</li>
            <li>All the businesses in an industry</li>
            <li>All the customers of a business</li>
            <li>All people that play football who are older than 45</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and so on - it just depends on what you want to know about.</p>
        <p>Gathering data about the population will give you a <strong>sample</strong>. This is a part of the whole population. Statistical methods are then used on that sample.</p>
        <p>The results of the statistical methods from the sample is used to make <strong>conclusions</strong> about the population.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The word 'statistic' can also refer to specific bits of knowledge; like the average value of something.</p>
        <h2>Important Concepts in Statistics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Predictions and Explanations</li>
            <li>Populations and Samples</li>
            <li>Parameters and Sample Statistics</li>
            <li>Sampling Methods</li>
            <li>Data Types</li>
            <li>Measurement Level</li>
            <li>Descriptive Statistics</li>
            <li>Random Variables</li>
            <li>Univariate and Multivariate Statistics</li>
            <li>Probability Calculation</li>
            <li>Probability Distributions</li>
            <li>Statistical Inference</li>
            <li>Parameter Estimation</li>
            <li>Hypothesis Testing</li>
            <li>Correlation</li>
            <li>Regression Analysis</li>
            <li>Causal Inference</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will cover these topics step by step in this tutorial.</p>
        <h2>Statistics and Programming</h2>
        <p>Statistical analysis is typically done with computers. Small amounts of data can analyzed reasonably well without computers.</p>
        <p>Historically, all data analysis was performed by manually. It was time-consuming and prone to errors.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, programming and software is typically used for data analysis.</p>
