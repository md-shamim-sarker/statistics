        <h1>Statistics - Average</h1>
        <p>An average is a measure of where most of the values in the data are located.</p>
        <h2>The Center of the Data</h2>
        <p>The center of the data is where most of the values in the data are located. Averages are measures of the
            location of the center.</p>
        <p>There are different types of averages. The most commonly used are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mean</li>
            <li>Median</li>
            <li>Mode</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Note: In statistics, averages are often referred to as 'measures of central tendency'.</p>
        <p>For example, using the values:</p>
        <p class="value">40, 21, 55, 21, 48, 13, 72</p>
        <h2>Mean</h2>
        <p>The mean is usually referred to as 'the average'.</p>
        <p>The mean is the sum of all the values in the data divided by the total number of values in the data:</p>
        <p class="value">(40 + 21 + 55 + 31 + 48 + 13 + 72)/7 = 38.57</p><br>
        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> There are are multiple types of mean values. The most common type of mean is
                the arithmetic
                mean.</p>
            <p>In this tutorial, 'mean' refers to the arithmetic mean.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Median</h2>
        <p>The median is the 'middle value' of the data.</p>
        <p>The median is found by ordering all the values in the data and picking the middle value:</p>
        <p class="value">13, 21, 21, 40, 48, 55, 72</p>
        <p>The median is less influenced by extreme values in the data than the mean.</p>
        <p>Changing the last value to 356 does not change the median:</p>
        <p class="value">13, 21, 21, 40, 48, 55, 356</p>
        <p>The median is still 40.</p>
        <p>Changing the last value to 356 changes the mean a lot:</p>
        <div class="value">
            <p>(13 + 21 + 21 + 40 + 48 + 55 + 72)/7 = 38.57</p>
            <p>(13 + 21 + 21 + 40 + 48 + 55 + 356)/7 = 79.14</p>
        </div><br>
        <p class="note">Note: Extreme values are values in the data that are much smaller or larger than the average
            values in the data.</p>

        <h2>Mode</h2>
        <p>The mode is the value(s) that appears most often in the data:</p>
        <p class="value">40, 21, 55, 21, 48, 13, 72</p>
        <p>Here, 21 appears two times, and the other values only once. The mode of this data is 21.</p>
        <p>The mode is also used for categorical data, unlike the median and mean. Categorical data can't be described
            directly with numbers, like names:</p>
        <p class="value">Alice, John, Bob, Maria, John, Julia, Carol</p>
        <p>Here, John appears two times, and the other values only once. The mode of this data is John.</p>
        <p class="note">Note: There can be more than one mode if multiple values appear the same number of times in the
            data.</p>
