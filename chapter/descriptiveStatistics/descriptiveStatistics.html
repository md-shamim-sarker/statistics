        <h1>Statistics - Descriptive Statistics</h1>
        <p>Descriptive statistics gives us insight into data without having to look at all of it in detail.</p>
        <h2>Key Features to Describe about Data</h2>
        <p>Getting a quick overview of how the data is distributed is a important step in statistical methods.</p>
        <p>We calculate key numerical values about the data that tells us about the distribution of the data. We also draw graphs showing visually how the data is distributed.</p>
        <p>Key Features of Data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where is the center of the data? (location)</li>
            <li>How much does the data vary? (scale)</li>
            <li>What is the shape of the data? (shape)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These can be described by <strong>summary statistics</strong> (numerical values).</p>
        <h3>The Center of the Data</h3>
        <p>The <strong>center</strong> of the data is where most of the values are concentrated.</p>
        <p>Different kinds of averages, like mean, median and mode, are <strong>measures</strong> of the center.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Measures of the center are also called <strong>location parameters</strong>, because they tell us something about where data is 'located' on a number line.</p>
        <h3>The Variation of the Data</h3>
        <p>The <strong>variation</strong> of the data is how spread out the data are around the center.</p>
        <p>Statistics like standard deviation, range and quartiles are <strong>measures</strong> of variation.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Measures of variation are also called scale parameters.</p>

        <h3>The Shape of the Data</h3>
        <p>The shape of the data can refer to the how the data are bunched up on either side of the center.</p>
        <p>Statistics like <strong>skew</strong> describe if the right or left side of the center is bigger. Skew is one type of <strong>shape parameters</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Frequency Tables</h3>
        <p>One typical of presenting data is with <strong>frequency tables.</strong></p>
        <p>A <strong>frequency table</strong> counts and orders data into a table. Typically, the data will need to be sorted into intervals.</p>
        <p>Frequency tables are often the basis for making graphs to visually present the data.</p>

        <h2>Visualizing Data</h2>
        <p>Different types of graphs are used for different kinds of data. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie charts for qualitative data</li>
            <li>Histograms for quantitative data</li>
            <li>Scatter plots for bivariate data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Graphs often have a close connection to numerical summary statistics.</p>
        <p>For example, box plots show where the <strong>quartiles</strong> are.</p>
        <p>Quartiles also tell us where the minimum and maximum values, range, interquartile range, and median are.</p>
