        <h1>Statistics - Making Conclusions</h1>
        <p>Using statistics to make conclusions about a population is called statistical inference.</p>

        <h2>Statistical Inference</h2>
        <p>Statistics from the data in the <strong>sample</strong> is used to make conclusions about the whole <strong>population</strong>. This is a type of <strong>statistical inference</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Probability theory</strong> is used to calculate the certainty that those statistics also apply to the population.</p>
        <p>When using a sample, there will <strong>always</strong> be some uncertainty about what the data looks like for the population.</p>
        <p>Uncertainty is often expressed as <strong>confidence intervals</strong>.</p>
        <p>Confidence intervals are numerical ways of showing how likely it is that the <strong>true value</strong> of this statistic is within a certain range for the population.</p>
        <p><strong>Hypothesis testing</strong> is a another way of checking if a statement about a population is true. More precisely, it checks how likely it is that a hypothesis is true is based on the sample data.</p>
        <p>Some examples of statements or questions that can be checked with hypothesis testing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>People in the Netherlands taller than people in Denmark</li>
            <li>Do people prefer Pepsi or Coke?</li>
            <li>Does a new medicine cure a disease?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing are closely related and describe the same things in different ways. Both are widely used in science.</p>
        <h2>Causal Inference</h2>
        <p>Causal inference is used to investigate if something causes another thing.</p>
        <p>For example: Does rain make plants grow?</p>
        <p>If we think two things are related we can investigate to see if they <strong>correlate</strong>. Statistics can be used to find out how strong this relation is.</p>
        <p>Even if things are correlated, finding out of something is caused by other things can be difficult. It can be done with good <strong>experimental design</strong> or other special statistical techniques.</p>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Good experimental design is often difficult to achieve because of ethical concerns or other practical reasons.</p>
